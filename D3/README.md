# Welcome to Data Engineer - Training Week 1!

The purpose of the first study week is to build a solid foundation in the basics of data engineering:  

- Become familiar with the diverse landscape of data structures and how information is represented.  
- Learn necessary tools for efficient data manipulation and analysis.  
- Get an introduction to Git (version control)

Collectively, these chapters form a comprehensive initiation into the multifaceted world of data engineering.

## Learning goals

- **Know how** = you have used the mentioned feature multiple times  
- **Can utilize** = you have used the mentioned feature at least once  
- **Have knowledge** = you have at least heard about the feature and can utilize it in information retrieval

## After completing week 1, you:

### Git
- **Know how** to use Git & GitHub in version control:  
  - `git add`  
  - `git commit`  
  - `git push`  
  - `git pull`  
  - `git checkout`  

### Python
- **Know how** to:  
  - Read and write JSON files  
  - Handle Python dictionaries  
  - Get JSON data from an interface (API)  
  - Run Python files from the command line  
  - Make a Python program that takes input data from the command line (command line parameters)  

### Formats & Data Types
- **Have knowledge** of:  
  - Different data formats (JSON, XML, CSV, Parquet, ORC, YAML)  
  - The meaning of structured vs. unstructured data  
  - Different data types in Python  
- **Can utilize** different data formats and data types in different situations and explain why that format is used  

### Python Libraries: Pandas & NumPy
- **Pandas**  
  - Can utilize Pandas library in data handling  
  - Knows how to read and save data in different formats:  
    - `read_csv()`, `to_csv()`, `to_sql()`  
  - Knows critical preprocessing functions:  
    - `isna()`, `fillna()`, `unique()`, `nunique()`, `shape()`, `dtypes()`, `drop()`, `astype()`, `drop_duplicates()`, `replace()`  
  - Knows how to modify data:  
    - `melt()`, `groupby()`  
  - Knows how to set/reset indexes:  
    - `set_index()`, `reset_index()`  
  - Knows how to combine data:  
    - `merge()`, `concat()`  
  - Understands row/column operations:  
    - `apply()`, `iterrows()`  
  - Knows how to handle timestamps:  
    - `to_datetime()` (can also be outside Pandas)  

- **NumPy**  
  - Can utilize NumPy library in data handling  
  - Knows how to handle and create NumPy array objects  
  - Knows how to use mathematical functions:  
    - `np.random.randint()`, `np.max()`, `np.min()`, `np.median()`, `np.mean()`, `np.round()`, `np.floor()` …  
  - Knows how to clean data:  
    - Remove null values  
    - Modify datatypes of columns  
    - Merge timestamps  
    - Handle missing values (`NaN`)  
    - Check the uniqueness of values
